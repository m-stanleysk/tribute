      <p>Alexander Siddig, known to his fans as "Sid", has performed in movies and TV shows including <em>A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia</em>, <em>Syriana</em>, and <em>Foundation</em>, but he's most beloved in his role as Dr. Julian Bashir in <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.</em></p>
      <p>Since Deep Space Nine ended, Sid has maintained contact with Star Trek fans through his official fan club and through conventions. When COVID-19 struck in 2020, Sid and his long-time fan club president decided to volunteer their time to bring his fans together online, creating the "Sid City Social Club". Attendees had the opportunity to speak to Sid one-on-one, and thriving online community was created that is still meeting today.</p>
